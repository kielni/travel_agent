Collect information for an Airbnb listing page.

Go to {start_url}.
Click the "Filters" button.
Use the scrollbar in the open modal to scroll down until the "Bedrooms" section is visible.
Click the "+" button next to "Bedrooms" twice until it shows 2.
Click the "+" button next to "Beds" twice until it shows 2.
Click the black button at the bottom to apply the filters.
Print the URL of the page.
A listing consists of a picture, bold title text, description text, and a price.
Consider only listings where the bold text contains "in {results_in}". If it doesn't, skip the listing and continue to the next one.
Use the scrollbar to scroll down to the end of the page to find all listings on the page.
For each listing, extract the following details:
  - If the bold text does not contain "in {results_in}", skip this listing and continue to the next one.
  - Extract the bold text and save it to "title"
  - Extract the rest of the text and save it to "description"
  - Find an <a> tag that links to a room (href starts with "/rooms/"). Extract the href attribute, and save  as "url".
  - Find the first image inside the listing block and extract its src or srcset attribute and save it as "picture_url".
  - Extract the price from text like "$1,234.00 for 5 nights" and save it to "price"
  - Extract the number of beds and save it to "beds"
After reaching the end of the page, use the pagination number links to go to the next page.
Repeat extracting the listings until there are no more pages, or no listings on the page matched "in {results_in}".
